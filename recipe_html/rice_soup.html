        <h3><strong>What is Congee?</strong></h3>
            <p>Congee, known as Chinese rice porridge comfort food, is a dish typically eaten at breakfast, but holds up anytime of the day. It’s made by slow simmering a small amount of rice in a large quantity of water or broth, creating a thick, starchy batch of comforting goodness.</p>
            <p>Growing up, I ate a variety of porridge, most often lugaw, a Filipino version made with garlic, ginger, rice, chicken, and topped with fish sauce, scallions, chicharron, and calamansi juice.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>How to Make Congee</strong></h3>
            <p>When making congee you can slow simmer the rice with just water, but if you’re aiming for richness in flavor, I suggest boiling the chicken for 40 mins with scallions, garlic and ginger to get a well-seasoned broth (sharing the specifics below).</p>
            <p>Conversely, you can just use bone broth, but I prefer the scratch-made way.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>Let’s Talk Important Stuff: The Toppings</strong></h3>
            <p>The cherry-on-top to congee are the add-ons:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Slivered scallions</li>
                    <li>Fresh ginger</li>
                    <li>Fish sauce</li>
                    <li>Chili oil</li>
                    <li>Dried shrimp</li>
                    <li>Fried shallots</li>
                    <li>Jammy eggs</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Congee without all the fixin’s is great, but topped with all the extras ALWAYS makes it taste so much better</p>
        
        <h3><strong>A Little Food Science on Rice</strong></h3>
            <p>Broken rice–fragments of rice grains that occur during processing–is typically used to make congee, but I like to use sushi rice. It’s a short grain varietal of rice and higher in starch. You want to aim for short-grain vs long-grain rice, as short grain rice absorbs more water, causing a gelation effect compared to long-grain rice, which doesn’t absorb as much water when soaked or cooked.</p>
            <p>Think of when you try cooking sushi, short or medium-grain rice and you’ll notice it’s stickier vs when cooking jasmine, basmati or long-grain rice. This is because of the starches and they’re levels of permeability to water–more absorbent. Starchier and more amylopectin for short-grain rice and less absorbent for long grain rice (more amylose).</p>
            <p>What am I getting at here? Basically, use sushi rice when making congee and you’ll be good to go.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1 large shallot, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon avocado oil</li>

        <h4><strong>Jammy Eggs</strong></h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 eggs</li>
                    <li>Ice bath, bowl filled with ice and cold water</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        
        <h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a pot, add chicken, water, scallions, ginger, garlic cloves and bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer and cook for 40 mins or until chicken begins to shred.</li>
                    <li>Remove and discard scallions, ginger and garlic. Remove chicken and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add rice and salt and bring to a boil. Once contents come to a boil, scrape the bottom, ensuring rice has not stuck to the pan. Lower heat to a simmer and cover pan.</li>
                    <li>Cook for 1 hour, stirring every 10-15 minutes, making sure rice does not stick to the pan.</li>
                    <li>While cooking, shred chicken breast with a fork. This will be added to the congee at the end. If you’re making fried shallots and.or jammy eggs, this would be a great time to start.</li>
                    <li>Once the congee has thickened (similar to oatmeal), turn off heat and stir in shredded chicken.</li>
                    <li>Ladle congee into bowls and add desired toppings. I prefer topping with scallions, fresh ginger, fish sauce, and chili oil</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

                </ol>
            </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Jammy Eggs Instructions</strong></h4>
